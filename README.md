# Garden Gnome
The "Garden Gnome" is a Mod for the game "The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth".

Some parts are provided by the developers of the game (Nicalis), like the graphics for the shopkeepers. Those graphics and animations are freely usable and editable.
All the other graphics are done by me as well as the code in main.lua.
